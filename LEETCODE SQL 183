Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.
Return the result table in any order.
---------------------------------------------------------------

select c.name as Customers from Customers c
left join Orders o
on c.id = o.customerID
where o.id IS NULL



another approach is 

--------------------------------
select c.name as Customers 
from Customers c where 
c.name not in (select c.name from Customers c
inner join Orders o
on c.id = o.customerID
)
